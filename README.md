# react-base

A repository for all things react & redux

This is the order in which I had started working on it. Naturally, newer the project, lesser the documentation.

* [think_react](think_react/)
* [2do](2do/)
* [shopsuggest](shopsuggest/)
* [my_mdb](my_mdb/)

Another folder, _egghead_reference_ is added. Ideally, to get started with redux, refer to [Egghead's videos](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) by the creator himself. It is crucial to understand the philosophy of redux before you get started working with it.
