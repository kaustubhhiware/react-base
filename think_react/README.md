# think_react

This is a basic react app, which was made as was learned. [Thinking in react ](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) is a perfect starting point.

Given a list of preset options, it allows searching among the options, akin to Amazon's search, but the search is more comparable to json in terms of searching.

Run it with: `npm start`
